# Web_Design_Recipes
A handy repository of web designs recipes (WRD) inspired from websites, built from scratch, etc.   Each WDR project features extensive commentary and showcases functional examples of models featured in CSS Recipes.

## What is this?
Each file contains a stand-alone website that contain features of interest.  From these experimental models, deconstructed elements such as navigation, menus, etc. are examined with extensive commentary.
